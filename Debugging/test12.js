// Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition



// The myFunc() function contains an infinite loop because the terminal condition i != 4 will never evaluate to false (and break the looping) - i will increment by 2 each pass, and jump right over 4 since i is odd to start. Fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition so the loop only runs for i less than or equal to 4.


// Waiting:Your code should change the comparison operator in the terminal condition (the middle part) of the for loop.
// Waiting:Your code should fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition of the loop.

    for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i += 2) {
      console.log("Still going!");
    }
