// Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

// I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

// You should use two double quotes (") and four escaped double quotes (\").
// Passed:Variable myStr should contain the string: I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".



const myStr ="I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; 
 // Change this line;
