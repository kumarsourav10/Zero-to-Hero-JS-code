// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

// a should equal 5.
// Waiting:b should equal -6.
// Waiting:c should equal 2.
// Waiting:You should use the -= operator for each variable.
// Waiting:You should not modify the code above the specified comment..

/*
this is the question

let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a = a - 6;
b = b - 15;
c = c - 1;
*/

// This is the answer
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
 a -= 6;
 b -= 15;
c -= 1;
