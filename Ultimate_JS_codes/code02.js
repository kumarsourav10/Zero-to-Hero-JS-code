const { error } = require("console");

let a = 67 // a Contains 67
console.log(a)
a = "Sourav"
console.log(a)

// in the Javascript you can set the value twice thrice like i set the value to a twice but it will overright the content to newest one .


//let 8Sourav = 7;  

// This is not the right way to set the value JavaScript will never allow you to start identifier value by integer like 8 or number a

// and you can not use reserved word to set the value to dentifier like 

//  let var = 10

// let var and many more words are reserved you can google it for your knowledge

// JavaSrcipt are caseSensitive see the following example;

let see = "This is";
console.log(see)


// now the same thing and just change the see to capital letterand see the result


// let see = "This is";
// console.log(See)


// This will give you an error
