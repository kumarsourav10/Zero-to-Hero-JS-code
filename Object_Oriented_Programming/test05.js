// Define a Constructor Function


// Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

// Here is an example of a constructor:

//                                                               Tests
// Waiting:Dog should have a name property set to a string.
// Waiting:Dog should have a color property set to a string.
// Waiting:Dog should have a numLegs property set to a number.

// There is no code for help just do it by yourself


// Answer The Question

function Dog () 
{ 
   this.name = "Tommy",
   this.color = "Black",
   this.numLegs = 4
}
