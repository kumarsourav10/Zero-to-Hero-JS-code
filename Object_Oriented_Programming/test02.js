// Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object


// The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

//                                                                Tests 
// Waiting:Your code should use console.log to print the value for the name property of the dog object.
// Waiting:Your code should use console.log to print the value for the numLegs property of the dog object.

// This is the code 

/*

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Only change code below this line

*/


// This is the code ans

let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4
  };
  // Only change code below this line
  
  console.log(dog.name)
  console.log(dog.numLegs)
