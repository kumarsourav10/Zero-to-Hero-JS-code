// For this challenge, chewieQuote has been initialized as the string Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh! behind the scenes. Create a regex chewieRegex that uses the * character to match an uppercase A character immediately followed by zero or more lowercase a characters in chewieQuote. Your regex does not need flags or character classes, and it should not match any of the other quotes.

let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
*/

// this is the answer code
// Only change code below this line
// let chewieRegex = /Aa*/; // Change this line
